Checklist
=========

[]  Does the MP add/remove user visible strings? If Yes, has the pot file been
    updated?

[]  Does the MP change the UI? If Yes, has it been approved by design?

[]  Did you perform an exploratory manual test run of your code change and any
    related functionality?

[]  If the MP fixes a bug or implements a feature, are there accompanying unit
    and autopilot tests?

[]  Is the file manager app trunk buildable and runnable using Clickable?

[]  Was the debian changelog updated?

[]  Was the copyright years updated if necessary?

The above checklist is more of a guideline to help file manager app trunk stay buildable,
stable and up to date.
